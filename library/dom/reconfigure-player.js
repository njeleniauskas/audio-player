/*
	things I should be doing with this function
	//gather data from live node state → text and time node && states and data from other nodes
	//is there a better way to do this? slice up?

	Questions:
	-----------
	- will this function break my event listeners?????? YES!!! shit.
		- could i just re-assign new listeners?
	- when should this function trigger? (at change of breakpoint (requires current + target to be known))
	- params needed: to what config
